## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.6.1  
* win-builder

## R CMD check results  
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs. There was 1 NOTE when `rsvg` was not installed (as expected).

NOTE: When testing without suggested packages, it raises and ERROR when needing 
rmarkdown to build vignettes. I don't know how (and whether) to avoid this.

## Downstream dependencies
There are currently no downstream dependencies.
